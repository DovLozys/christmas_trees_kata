# Christmas time!
This is **Christmas** season, so why don't we console.log a christmas tree?

You will be given the height of the tree, so for example if the `height` 
is `5` we would expect this result:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

and if the `height` is `3`, we would expect this:

```
  *
 ***
*****
```

### How to
Don't forget to `npm i` after cloning, and then once you've written your function
in `main.js`, do `npm test` to check if you got it right!

### Thanks to
everyone involved?
